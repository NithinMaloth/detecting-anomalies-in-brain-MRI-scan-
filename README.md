## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a brain tumor detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of brain MRI scans and is capable of classifying scans into four categories: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary.

The main steps of the project include:
- Data preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Building and training the CNN model.
- Evaluating the model's performance on a testing dataset.
- Detecting anomalies in new brain scan images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a collection of brain MRI scans categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and validate the model's performance.

You can find the dataset at [Dataset Source](link_to_dataset) or [Dataset Mirror](link_to_mirror).
